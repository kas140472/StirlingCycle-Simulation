## Storyboard (Round 2)

<center>Experiment: Stirling Cycle</center>

**1. Story Outline**:

The ideal Stirling cycle is a reversible thermodynamic cycle. It differs from the Carnot cycle in that the two isentropic processes are replaced by two constant-pressure regeneration processes.

The idealized Stirling cycle consists of four thermodynamic processes acting on the working fluid:
1-2 Isothermal compression.
2-3 Constant volume regeneration (internal heat transfer from the working fluid to the regenerator)
3-4 Isothermal expansion.
4-1 Constant volume regeneration (internal heat transfer from the regenerator back to the working fluid)

In this experiment, the Stirling cycle is demonstrated so that the user can understand how the P-V graph changes as various pressure and volume parameters change. The heat addition, heat rejection, net work output, as well as efficiency of the cycle is calculated and displayed.

 **2. Story**:

  **2.1 Set the visual stage description**:

The experiment consists of the P-v graph of Stirling cycle, shown in the main window. All the buttons and the parameters control are on the right side of the frame. The variable panel contains sliders for pressures P1 and P3, and volumes v1 and v3.
The setup consists of a graph that depicts the Stirling cycle. A legend at the top indicates the processes involved in each of the curves.
By changing the various parameters, the P-V graph changes. By changing the parameters, like P1, the pressure at the beginning of the isothermal compression process changes. Similarly, when changing v3, the volume at the beginning of the isothermal expansion process changes. Similar results follow when other parameters are changed.

  **2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals**:

* Understand the various processes involved in the Stirling cycle.
* Calculate P2, P4, v2 and v4.
* Calculate the Qin (heat added), Qout (heat rejected) and Wnet (Net work output).
* Calculate the efficiency of the Stirling cycle.
* Analyze the effect of change in parameters (P1, P3, v1, v3 ) on Qin (heat added), Qout(heat rejected), Wnet (Net work output), and efficiency of the Stirling cycle.
* Visualise the change in the P-v graph as the parameters(P1, P3, v1, v3) are changed.
