#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concept, Experimentation

<u>About the Experiment:</u><br>
The ideal Stirling cycle is a reversible thermodynamic cycle. It differs from the Carnot cycle in that the two isentropic processes are replaced by two constant-pressure regeneration processes.

The idealized Stirling cycle consists of four thermodynamic processes acting on the working fluid:
1-2 Isothermal compression.
2-3 Constant volume regeneration (internal heat transfer from the working fluid to the regenerator)
3-4 Isothermal expansion.
4-1 Constant volume regeneration (internal heat transfer from the regenerator back to the working fluid)

In this experiment, the Stirling cycle is demonstrated so that the user can understand how the P-V graph changes as various pressure and volume parameters change. The heat addition, heat rejection, net work output, as well as efficiency of the cycle is calculated and displayed.
